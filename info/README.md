# Snek.

## Warning: Out of date

*Snek.* was an iOS game and, as such, required endless maintenance to stay up to date with Apple's ever changing requirements. I stopped doing that and now it's not there anymore.

Still, you can take a look at the source code if you'd like to.

## Description
Snek. was written in Objective-C using Apple XCode 4.6 and the Kobold2D library. The kick drum and snare sounds are from freesounds.org. Snek. works on iPhones, iPods and iPads that have a gyroscope. You should make a video of yourself playing and send it to me.
